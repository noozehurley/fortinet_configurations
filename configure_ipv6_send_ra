## configure_ipv6_send_ra ##

Enabling Fortinet interface(s) to send IPv6 Route Advertisements on the LAN is not quite as simple as enabling the obvious configuration nob found in the CLI configuration of a Fortinet firewall.

To enable a fortinet interface to send IPv6 RAs on a LAN, reference the configuration located below, with v6 address fd00:1::/64 used as an example.


    edit "portXX"

        config ipv6

            set ip6-address fd00:1::1/64
# Enables interface to Send RAs
            set ip6-send-adv enable
# Enables DNS Flag to be sent with the RA
            set ip6-other-flag enable
#Create Prefix List that says what subnet to send RAs on, and to enable various flags
            config ip6-prefix-list

                edit fd00:1::/64

                    set autonomous-flag enable

                    set onlink-flag enable

                next

            end

        end
        
  
  After configuring this, IPv6 RAs should be sent on the LAN.
